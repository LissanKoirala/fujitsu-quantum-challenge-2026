# Architecture

Keep this lean until we agree on the actual design.

## Current Direction
- Two implementations: Qiskit and Fujitsu DA
- Shared utilities in `src/shared/`
- Notebooks for research and validation

## Decisions Needed
- Core algorithm choice
- Interface between Qiskit and Fujitsu paths
- Shared data formats

When those are decided, expand this doc.
