# Contributing

Keep it simple and low overhead.

## Workflow
- Branch from `main`
- Make focused commits
- Open a PR for review

## Code Style
- Python, PEP 8
- Type hints where helpful
- Prefer clear names over cleverness

## Tests
- Add/adjust tests when behavior changes
- Run `pytest tests/` before PRs

## Docs
- Update docs only if the change impacts others
